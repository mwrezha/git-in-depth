## Git Fundations

First I may not talk about what we usually do with git, but I will briefly review what git does when we use git commands

### Git Storage

how Git stores information comparing it to a key-value store where data is the value and the hash of the data is the key. This system is also known as content-addressable storage, which is when the content to generate the key.

- you can then use the key to retrieve the content
- the key it's called a SHA1, is cryptographic hash function given a piece of data.
- it produces a 40-digit hexadecimal number and this value should always be the same if the given input is the same

### Git Blobs and Trees

In the .git directory, how git stores project information and its metadata into blob, tree, and commits objects, with each object storing different parts of the project like its content and folder structure. Deleting the .git directory, the information and history of the project are gone, but not the files of the project.

### Git Commit

Commits, which is an object that stores the current contents of the project in a new commit with a log message from the user describing the changes, there's three types of object will create when we do git commit

- Tree
- Blob
- Commit

## Git Areas and Stashing

### Working Area (Working Tree)

The working area is where files that are not handled by git. These files are also referred to as "untracked files." Because kind of just in your local directory.
The working area it's where you can add new content, modify and delete content

### Staging Area (Cache)

Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit

### Repository

The repository contains all of a project's commits. And the commits is a snapshop of what your working and staging area look like at the time of the commit

### Stashing

git stash which is saving work that is not committed to a git repo and is also safe from destructive operations. find more about git stash command [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)

[here](https://github.com/nnja/advanced-git/blob/master/exercises/Exercise2-StagingAndStashing.md) for exercice to advanced about staging and stashing

## References (_pointers to commits_)

Three types of git references is Branches, Head and Tags & Annotated Tags

- A **Branch** is just a pointer to a particular commit, The pointer of the current branch changes as new commits are
made.
- **HEAD** is how git knows what branch you’re currently on, and what the next parent will be.
  - It usually points at the _**name**_ of the current branch. But, it can point at a commit too (detached HEAD).
  - You make a commit in the currently active branch when you checkout a new branch

  ```
  % cat .git/HEAD
  ref: refs/heads/master

  % git checkout new_branch
  Switched to branch 'new_branch'
  
  % cat .git/HEAD          
  ref: refs/heads/new_branch

  ```

- **Tags** are just a simple pointer to a commit. When you create a tag with no arguments, it captures the value in HEAD

  ```
    % git checkout master    
    Switched to branch 'master'

    % git tag my-first-commit

    % tree .git/refs        
    .git/refs
    ├── heads
    │   ├── master
    │   └── new_branch
    └── tags
        └── my-first-commit

    2 directories, 3 files
  ```

- **Annotated Tags** Point to a commit, but store additional information. Author, message, date.

  ```
  % git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 of my repo"
  
  % git tag
  my-first-commit
  v1.0

  % git show v1.0
  tag v1.0

  ```

  ### Head-Less / Detached Head

  Sometimes you need to checkout a specific commit (or tag) instead of a branch. Git moves the HEAD pointer to the commit that you specified. When you check out a different branch or a commit, the value of HEAD's gonna change too, It's going to change to the next SHA. There is no reference pointing to the commits you made in a detached state.

  If you make any commits in a DETACHED HEAD state, they don't have any references to them. Git doesn't know how to point to them. Let me explain this with a diagram. I have a, I checked out a commit.

  Git tells me that I'm in a DETACHED HEAD state.

  ```
  % git checkout 99b21
  Note: switching to '99b21'.

  You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
  changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
  state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

  If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
  do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

    git switch -c <new-branch-name>

  Or undo this operation with:

    git switch -

  Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

  HEAD is now at 99b2172 Initial commit

  ```
  Can look around, make changes, I can commit them. If I don't do anything with the commits that I made in a DETACHED HEAD state, you can consider them lost.

  A detached head occurs when a commit is checked out instead of a branch. If a commit does not point or associates to a branch, the changes will not be references in git and eventually go to garbage collection.
